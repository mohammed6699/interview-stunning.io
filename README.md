## First I created teh main structre of teh project which is:
    . Backend Folder: where the server setup and every data related to it located
    . Frintend Folder: where the UI setup and fetching tha data came from server also handle the error and loading
### First I write the prompt to Copilot to tell him about the steps to move on while creating the backend server using NEST Ts, but there is a too many errors happen after tracing it, I convert it to js fro ts but the errors still due to some configuration for typeScript, So I Little change it to be express js and mongoose to handle data base

### after finish the backend and run teh server to make sure it's actually running I create teh prompt for the front end to handlle fetch data and error handling
